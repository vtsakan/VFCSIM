# VFCSIM
VFCSIM is a simulation framework for simulate scenarios based on virtual functions, both on edge and cloud environments. 
The main novel aspects of the proposed framework are:
(i) native support of V F and V F Cs, 
(ii) real-time interaction with the simulation environment, 
(iii) common simulation environment for Edge and Cloud based simulations and 
(iv) multi user access support.
